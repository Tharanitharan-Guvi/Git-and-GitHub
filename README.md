### 1. Introduction

#### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase over time. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, enabling collaboration among multiple developers on the same project.

#### 2. What is Github?

GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides additional features for collaboration, such as hosting repositories, managing issues, and facilitating pull requests. It acts as a central hub for developers to store, share, and collaborate on code.

- **Version Control**: Git helps track changes in code, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, offering features like branching and merging.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Code stored on GitHub serves as a backup, ensuring data integrity.
- **Community and Open Source**: GitHub fosters a sense of community, facilitating contributions to open-source projects.
